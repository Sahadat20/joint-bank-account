# Porject Title: Joint Bank Account

Description: Developed a decentralized application (DApp) that simulates a joint bank account on the Ethereum blockchain. This project allows multiple users to manage and access a shared account with smart contracts ensuring security and transparency.

# Key Features:

• Smart Contract Implementation: Designed and deployed Solidity smart contracts to handle joint account
functionalities such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance tracking.
• Decentralized Architecture: Utilized HardHat for development and testing, ensuring robust contract
performance and reliability.
• User Authentication: Integrated Metamask for secure user authentication and transaction management.
• Frontend Development: Built a responsive user interface using JavaScript and Node.js, enabling users to
interact seamlessly with the blockchain.
• Blockchain Interaction: Employed Ether.js to facilitate communication between the frontend and
Ethereum blockchain, ensuring smooth transaction handling.

# Technology Used:

• HardHat: For development, testing, and deployment of smart contracts.
• Metamask: For user authentication and transaction management.
• Ether.js: For blockchain interaction and transaction handling.
• Solidity: For writing and deploying smart contracts.
• Node.js: For backend development and server-side logic.
• JavaScript: For frontend development and creating a responsive user interface.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
